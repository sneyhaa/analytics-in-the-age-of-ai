📈 Project 1: Cohort Retention & Growth Analytics in the Age of AI

🚀 Series: Analytics in the Age of AI
This is the first project in a hands-on series exploring market-ready analytics with modern data practices and AI-integrated thinking. Each project tackles real-world business questions using streamlined, modular, and reusable data analysis workflows.

🧠 Objective
- To simulate and analyze user behavior in a fictional e-commerce platform and answer:
- How well are we retaining users over time?
- Are some acquisition channels outperforming others in retention?
- What patterns can we detect across user cohorts?
- How can this inform our growth strategy?

📊 Dataset Overview
We simulate a 90-day e-commerce dataset with the following fields:

- user_id: Unique identifier for each customer
- signup_date: Date the user first signed up
- purchase_date: Date of each purchase made
- amount: Purchase amount in USD
- channel: Acquisition source (organic, paid_ads, referral, social)
- product_category: Type of product purchased (clothing, electronics, etc.)

- Total records: ~5,000 users and ~15,000 transactions (simulated using Python)

📘 Key Analyses Performed
- Cohort Analysis (Weekly Signups)
- Cohort tables and retention heatmaps
- Drop-off analysis over 12-week windows
- Acquisition Channel Comparison
- Channel-level retention breakdown
- Growth funnel comparison by channel
- Lifetime Value (LTV) Estimation
- LTV by cohort, channel, and category
- High-value segment identification
- Growth Insights & Strategy Suggestions
- Retention trends and drop-off triggers

🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

📈 Business Impact
- Identified 23% retention drop-off at Week 4 across all cohorts
- Discovered referral channel has 40% higher 12-week retention vs paid ads
- Estimated $2.3M annual revenue opportunity from improving Week 4 retention
- Built reusable framework saving 3+ hours per cohort analysis

✅ What’s Next
- Add AI-assisted churn prediction (Project 2)
- Deploy insights into an interactive dashboard
- Extend retention models to domain-specific use cases (e.g., subscriptions, education, etc.)

💡 Final Thought
Retention is growth's best friend. This project is a step toward building frameworks that don't just describe the past — they drive the future with insights powered by data and AI.
