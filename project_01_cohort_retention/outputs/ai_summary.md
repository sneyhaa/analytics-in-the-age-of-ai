Here's a concise product analyst summary based on the cohort retention matrix and channel-level user data:

📈 1. Best Performing Cohort
Cohort 01-2024 shows the strongest long-term retention and is the only cohort with observable data through week 12.

Despite a steady decline, it retains ~14.5% of users by week 12—far higher than later cohorts.

Within this cohort, email and paid_search channels drive the highest week 1 retention (86%+), with organic also maintaining solid engagement.

📉 2. Drop-off Patterns
Sharp early drop-offs across all cohorts:

Most users leave between week 0 and week 2.

02-2024 and 03-2024 cohorts see retention fall below 35% by week 3, with 03-2024 dropping to 0.1% by week 4—a significant churn indicator.

Channel-level drop-offs:

Direct and referral show smaller volume and high variability.

Email and paid_search retain users better into weeks 4–6.

Social_media has erratic behavior—e.g., increase from week 1→2 in 01-2024 (possibly due to re-engagement campaigns or lagging attribution).

💡 3. Suggestions to Improve Retention
🔍 Focus on Early Engagement:
Since most churn happens in the first 2–3 weeks, introduce onboarding nudges, educational content, or personalized offers during this period.

🎯 Channel Optimization:
Double down on email & paid_search: They consistently bring in more engaged users.

Consider improving social media targeting or post-click experience to reduce erratic retention trends.

📅 A/B Test Winback Campaigns:
Especially for week 4–6 drop-offs, test reactivation flows like email reminders, discounts, or product updates.

📊 Expand Attribution Windows:
Lag in retention bumps (e.g., social_media week 2) suggests users might be engaging later—check tracking windows or attribution accuracy.

⚠️ Data Gaps & Next Steps
Retention data is missing beyond week 4 for newer cohorts (esp. 03-2024); continue monitoring to validate patterns.

Investigate the low 3-month LTV of later cohorts, likely tied to fast churn.
